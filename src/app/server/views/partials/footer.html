                            <p>Co-founder of the Emergent Technology Center, R. Scott Blamey is described as a catalyst for change; Blamey is not someone who waits for the next big thing. He is usually the one with the idea, leading the charge and inspiring those around him to join in and make a difference. And that is exactly what he has been up to. In April of 2014, Blamey co-founded the Emergent Technology Center â€“ a mentor-driven emerging technologies seed accelerator serving entrepreneurs in northeastern Wisconsin. This initiative is expected to generate new types of businesses for Fond du Lac and allow technology to rise to the forefront. Understanding the importance of attracting, developing and retaining advanced IT talent in the Fond du Lac area, Blamey is committed to continued growth and thanks to his many contributions, additional expansion is already in the works.</p>
                            <p>Outside of work, Blamey is involved in numerous committees and industry groups, including Forward Fond du Lac, the Northeast Wisconsin IT Industry Sector Group, MPTC Digital Marketing Advisory Board, Digital Fertilizer Meetup and the Northeast Wisconsin Agile Users Group.</p>
                            <p>Clearly involved and exceptionally community minded, Blamey believes in the future of Fond du Lac.</p>
